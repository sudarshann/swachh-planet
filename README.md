# Swachh Planet Game

### About the Game

This HTML5 Game (has been happily made for the [Global Game Jam](https://globalgamejam.org/2020/games/swachh-planet-6). With Theme Repair.

You are Construction Truck in the game, Trying Repair/Fix the Damage Done. You need to click the mouse or tap (touch screen) to steer else Truck will Crash. If he hits the top or bottom boundaries that'll end the game with fatal accident.

There will be some obstacles along the way like cracks, branches and some enemies who are also known as "Trash", "Nuclear waste" and "Smog". Hitting them will end the game. 3 types of Enemies - Trash (pull you), Smog (push you), Nuclear waste (kill you). Keep safe distance from them!

There are some collectibles too! Trash for points (Waste Box for 50, Plastics for 100, Bottle for 500). Incognito Badge for invincibility for a short period. Collecting Construction Truck parked the way helps to spawning clones that'll Repair anything that comes in their way!

Collisions are not super strict to make the gameplay a little less harder.

Hit Enter or Spacebar keys to (re)start the game.

For Every Repair done and distance travelled your billing meter will estimate the cost of repairs done. When the Game Ends the final Bill with taxes are shown for the repair work you have done.
